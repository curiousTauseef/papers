<p>The Volcano query processing system uses the operator model of query execution that we all know and love. In this paper, Graefe discusses the <strong>exchange operator</strong>: an operator that you can insert into a query plan which automatically parallelizes the execution of the query plan. The exchange operator allows queries to be executed in parallel without having to rewrite existing operator.</p>
<h2 id="the-template-approach">The Template Approach</h2>
<p>Parallel databases like Gamma and Bubba used a <strong>template approach</strong> to query parallelization. With the template approach, algorithms are plugged into templates which abstract away the details of where tuples come from and where they are sent to. They also abstract away the mechanisms used to send a tuple over the network or to another process using some IPC mechanism. Unfortunately, the template approach <em>required</em> that tuples either be sent over the network or over IPC which greatly reduced its performance.</p>
<h2 id="volcano-design">Volcano Design</h2>
<p>Volcano implements queries as a tree of iterators with an open-next-close interface. The paper discusses something called state records which allow the same operator multiple times with different parameters, though this seems obsolete now that we have modern programming languages. Iterators return structures which contain record ids and pointers to the records which are pinned in the buffer pool.</p>
<h2 id="the-operator-model-of-parallelization">The Operator Model of Parallelization</h2>
<p>In the operator model of parallelization, exchange operators are placed in query plans which automatically parallelize its execution. Exchange operators provide three forms of parallelism.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Pipeline parallelism.</strong> The exchange operator allows its child and parent to run in different processes. When opened, the exchange operator forks a child and establishes a region of shared memory called a <strong>port</strong> which the parent and child use to communicate with one another. The child part of the exchange operator (known as the <strong>producer</strong>) continuously calls next on its child, buffers the records into batches called packets, and writes them into the port (with appropriate synchronization). The parent part of the exchange operator (known as the consumer <strong>consumer</strong>) reads a record from a packet in the port whenever its next method is invoked. For flow control, the producer can decrement a semaphore and the producer can increment a semaphore.</li>
<li><strong>Bushy parallelism.</strong> Busy parallelism is when multiple siblings in a query plan are executed in parallel. Bushy parallelism is really just pipeline parallelism applied to multiple siblings.</li>
<li><strong>Intra-operator parallelism.</strong> Intra-operator parallelism allows the same operator to run in parallel on multiple partitions of input data. As before, the exchange operator forks a (master) producer and establishes a port. This master producer forks other producers and gives them the location of the port. Each forked producer might eventually invoke another group of exchange operators. The master consumer will fork a master producer and create a port. Producers can send messages to producers using round-robin, hash, or range partitioning. When a node is out of records, its sends an end-of-stream message to all consumers. Consumers end their stream when they count the appropriate number of end-of-stream messages. Unlike the pipelined parallelism version of the exchange operator, the intra-operator version is not so obvious how to implement. Moreover, I think it involves modifications to the leaves of a query plan.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="variants-of-exchange">Variants of Exchange</h2>
<p>Producers can also broadcast tuples to consumers. A merge operator sits on top of an exchange operator and merges together the sorted streams produced by each producer. The paper also discusses sorting files and having exchange operators in the middle of a query fragment, but it's hard to understand.</p>
