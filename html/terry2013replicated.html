<p>Different cloud providers provide cloud storage with different mixes of consistency:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Azure</em> provides strong consistency.</li>
<li><em>Amazon S3</em> provides eventual consistency.</li>
<li><em>Amazon DynamoDB</em> provides eventual and strong consistency.</li>
<li><em>Amazon SimpleDB</em> provides eventual and strong consistency.</li>
<li><em>Google App Engine Datastore</em> provides eventual and strong consistency.</li>
<li><em>PNUTS</em> provides read-any, read-critical, and read-latest.</li>
<li>Some systems provide quorum reads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloud providers are motivated to provide multiple consistency guarantees due to the inherit tradeoff between consistency, performance, and availability. This paper presents six consistency models in plain English and motivates their use with a baseball application.</p>
<p><strong>Read Consistency Guarantees.</strong> Assuming writes linearized using something like Paxos, we define six read consistency guarantees:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Strong consistency (SC).</em> Reads reflect all writes at the point of the read.</li>
<li><em>Eventual consistency (EC).</em> Reads reflect some subset of the writes that happened at the point of the read.</li>
<li><em>Consistent prefix (CP).</em> Reads reflect some prefix of writes at the point of the read. This is most useful for multi-object reads.</li>
<li><em>Bounded staleness (BS).</em> Reads reflect all writes before some time <code>T</code> before the point of the read.</li>
<li><em>Monotonic reads (MR).</em> This session guarantee says that repeated reads reflect monotonically non-decreasing sets of writes.</li>
<li><em>Read my writes (RMW).</em> Reads followed by writes reflect the values written.</li>
</ul>
<p>These consistency guarantees can be organized using the following partial order:</p>
<pre><code>    SC
CP BS MR RMW
    EC</code></pre>
<p><strong>Baseball as a Sample Application.</strong> Imagine a key-value store which provides all of the read consistency guarantees outlined above. Consider a baseball application that writes home and visitor runs into two separate variables in this key value store. Consider the following game:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Write(&quot;home&quot;, 1)</code></li>
<li><code>Write(&quot;visitors&quot;, 1)</code></li>
<li><code>Write(&quot;home&quot;, 2)</code></li>
<li><code>Write(&quot;home&quot;, 3)</code></li>
<li><code>Write(&quot;visitors&quot;, 2)</code></li>
<li><code>Write(&quot;home&quot;, 4)</code></li>
<li><code>Write(&quot;home&quot;, 5)</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Read Requirements for Participants.</strong> Different users of the baseball database have different consistency requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Official scorekeeper.</em> The official scorekeeper is the sole person responsible for updating the scores (e.g. `Write(&quot;visitors&quot;, Read(&quot;visitors&quot;)</li>
<li>1)`). The scorekeeper requires strongly consistent writes, but since they are the only one writing, they can get by with RMW instead of SC.</li>
<li><em>Umpire.</em> The umpire reads the score after the top of the 9th inning to see if the home team is winning. This requires SC.</li>
<li><em>Radio reporter.</em> The radio reporter reports the current score of the game every 30 minutes. The score doesn't have to be fresh, but it should be a score that existed at some point. Moreover, the score should not time travel backwards. We can accomplish this with CP and MR. Alternatively, we can use 30-minute BS.</li>
<li><em>Sports writer.</em> The sports writer writes a report of the game one hour after the game is over. 1 hour BS suffices.</li>
<li><em>Statistician.</em> The statistician maintains the total yearly runs. They require SC to read the daily runs but only RMW to read the yearly runs.</li>
<li><em>Stat watcher.</em> Stat watchers read the stats every day or so. Eventual consistency suffices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lessons.</strong> - All of the six presented consistency guarantees are useful. - Different clients may want different consistencies even when accessing the same data. - Even simple databases may have diverse users with different consistency needs. - Clients should be able to choose their desired consistency.</p>
