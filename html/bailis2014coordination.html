<p><strong>Overivew.</strong> Coordination in a distributed system is sometimes necessary to maintain application correctness, or <em>consistency</em>. For example, a payroll application may require that each employee has a unique ID, or that a jobs relation only include valid employees. However, coordination is not cheap. It increases latency, and in the face of partitions can lead to unavailability. Thus, when application correctness permits, coordination should be avoided. This paper develops the necessary and sufficient conditions for when coordination is needed to maintain a set of database invariance using a notion of invariant-confluence or I-confluence.</p>
<p><strong>System Model.</strong> A <em>database state</em> is a set D of object versions drawn from the set of all states <em>D</em>. Transactions operate on <em>logical replicas</em> in <em>D</em> that contain the set of object versions relevant to the transaction. Transactions are modeled as functions T : <em>D</em> -&gt; <em>D</em>. The effects of a transaction are merged into an existing replica using an associative, commutative, idempotent merge operator. Changes are shared between replicas and merges likewise. In this paper, merge is set union, and we assume we know all transactions in advance. Invariants are modeled as boolean functions I: <em>D</em> -&gt; 2. A state R is said to be I-valid if I(R) is true.</p>
<p>We say a system has <em>transactional availability</em> if whenever a transaction T can contact servers with the appropriate data in T, it only aborts if T chooses to abort. We say a system is <em>convergent</em> if after updates quiesce, all servers eventually have the same state. A system is globally <em>I-valid</em> if all replicas always have I-valid states. A system provides coordination-free execution if execution of a given transaction does not depend on the execution of others.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency Sans Coordination.</strong> A state Si is <em>I-T-Reachable</em> if its derivable from I-valid states with transactions in T. A set of transactions is <em>I</em>-confluent with respect to invariant I if for all I-T-Reachable states Di, Dj with common ancestor Di join Dj is I-valid. A globally I-valid system can execute a set of transactions T with global validity, transactional availability, convergence, and coordination-freedom if and only if T is I-confluent with respect to I.</p>
<p><strong>Applying Invariant-Confluence.</strong> I-confluence can be applied to existing relation operators and constraints. For example, updates, inserts, and deletes are I-confluent with respect to per-record inequality constraint. Deletions are I-confluent with respect to foreign key constraints; additions and updates are not. I-confluence can also be applied to abstract data types like counters.</p>
