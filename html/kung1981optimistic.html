<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> OCC transactions are split into a read phase, a validation phase, and a write phase. A transaction is assigned a timestamp at the beginning of its validation phase, and validation passes if the transaction respects the serialization of transactions by their assigned timestamps. A serial validation implementation implements the validation and write phase atomically, and a parallel implementation allows for concurrent validation and write phases.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Lock-based concurrency control comes with a lot of overhead. If a transaction holds a lock while fetching data from disk, it may end up holding locks for quite a while. <em>Strict</em> two-phase locking is needed to ensure recoverability, so transactions cannot release locks early. Dealing with deadlock (be it avoidance or detection) also incurs some overhead. Worse yet, if transactions rarely conflict, this overhead is largely unnecessary.</p>
<p>In contrast with lock-based concurrency control, optimistic concurrency control (OCC) allows transactions to run with unbridled enthusiasm, reading and writing whatever they want with reckless abandon. Then, when a transaction goes to commit, the database validates that if the transaction were to commit, it would not violate serializability. If the validation is successful, the transaction commits; otherwise, it aborts. If conflicts are common, OCC leads to a lot of preventable aborts, but if conflicts are uncommon (e.g.&#160;with a read-mostly workload), OCC can incur less overhead than a lock-based approach.</p>
<p>In OCC, transactions are divided into three phases: a read phase, a validation phase, and a write phase.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <strong>read phase</strong>. &#8220;Read&#8221; is a bit of a misnomer here. During the read phase, transactions read from <em>and write to</em> the database, executing whatever logic they want. The only thing is that instead of writing directly into the database, they cache all of their writes.</li>
<li>The <strong>validation phase</strong>. The validation phase checks to make sure that a transaction commits only if doing so will preserve serializability. If a transaction validates, it will enter the write phase and then commit. It it does not validate, then it will abort and be restarted.</li>
<li>The <strong>write phase</strong>. During the write phase, a transaction copies its cached writes into the database.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-read-and-write-phases">The Read and Write Phases</h2>
<p>During the read phase, transactions cache their writes and maintain a <strong>read set</strong> (a set of all the objects read) and <strong>write set</strong> (a set of all the objects written). During the write phase, transactions flush their cached writes into the database. Besides that, there&#8217;s not much to say about the read and write phase. The paper goes into a bit of detail about how to perform the read and write phase for a particular object based data model, but the details are not particularly salient.</p>
<h2 id="the-validation-phase">The Validation Phase</h2>
<p>In OCC, every transaction is assigned a unique timestamp either during its read phase or at the beginning of its validation phase. For now, assume it is assigned at the beginning of its validation phase; we&#8217;ll talk more about this in a bit. OCC ensures that transactions are executed in a way that is equivalent to executing all transactions serially in timestamp order. The validation of a transaction $j$ follows the following logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>for every transaction $i &lt; j$:
<ol type="1">
<li>If the write set of $i$ overlaps the read set of $j$, then $i$ must finish completely before $j$ starts. Why is this? Well, if $j$ read something that $i$ wrote, then $i$ has to finish writing it before $j$ starts reading it. If $j$ were to read a value before $i$ wrote it, this would violate serializability.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the write set of $i$ overlaps with the write set of $j$, then $i$ has to finish its write phase before $j$ starts its write phase. Why is this? Well, we know that $i$ doesn&#8217;t write anything that $j$ reads, so we can overlap $i$&#8217;s write phase with $j$&#8217;s read phase if we want. But, we have to make sure that $i$&#8217;s writes happen before $j$&#8217;s writes since $i$ is serialized before $j$.</li>
<li>Otherwise, $i$ has to finish its read phase before $j$ finishes its read phase. Why is this? Well, we know that $i$ doesn&#8217;t write anything that $j$ reads or writes, so $i$ is free to write during $j$&#8217;s read or write phase. The only thing is that we have to be careful not to let $j$ write something that $i$ reads, which is forbidden since $i$ is serialized before $j$. To ensure this, we make sure that $i$ finishes its read phase completely, before $j$ has a chance to enter its validation or write phase. Note that if we assign timestamps at the beginning of the validation phase, then this condition is enforced automatically. $i &lt; j$ is only possible when $i$ finished its read phase before $j$.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we can also hand out timestamps during the read phase, but it might require a transaction to block when it enters its validation phase. Imagine we hand transaction $a$ a timestamp of 1. Then, we hand transaction $b$ a timestamp of $2$. If transaction $b$ finishes its read phase quickly and enters its validation phase, it has to wait for transaction $a$ to finish its read phase in order to know its read and write sets.</p>
<p>On the other hand, assigning timestamps at the beginning of the validation phase can lead to an unbounded number of read and write sets that we have to keep track of. If a transaction has a particularly long read phase, then when it enters its validation phase, it will have to know the read and write sets of all other transactions that started after it but entered their validation phase before it. Assigning timestamps during the read phase prevents this.</p>
<p>Finally, note that a transaction can be infinitely aborted and restarted if it gets really unlucky. To prevent this, we can assign each transaction a priority based on its age and allow a high priority transaction to start locking things if its been restarted too many times.</p>
<h2 id="serial-validation">Serial Validation</h2>
<p>Now we know the logical steps involved with validation, but how to we actually implement it. One way is to implement <strong>serial validation</strong> in which we atomically execute validation and write phases together. With this approach, the second and third conditions above are guaranteed automatically. All we need to do is ensure that for all overlapping transactions $i$, $i$ doesn&#8217;t write anything that we read. See <a href="https://github.com/mwhittaker/occ">github.com/mwhittaker/occ</a> for an implementation of serial validation.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-validation">Parallel Validation</h2>
<p>Parallel validation allows transactions to concurrently execute validation and write phases. Condition 3 from above is still guaranteed automatically, but we have to check condition 2. To do so, we abort if our write set overlaps any write set of a concurrently executing transaction. See the paper for details.</p>
