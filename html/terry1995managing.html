<p>Bayou is a replicated eventually consistent storage system designed to be run on a set of mobile servers and clients that are only intermittently connected. Unlike previous systems, Bayou uses application-specific logic to detect and resolve conflicts of concurrent writes. Servers gossip writes to one another and apply writes immediately (though tentatively). Clients can read tentative state at any time. Slowly over time, conflicts are resolved and writes are committed.</p>
<h2 id="motivating-examples">Motivating Examples</h2>
<p>Consider two motivating Bayou applications.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Meeting room scheduler.</strong> Consider an application like Google calendar which lets people reserve a particular room for a particular amount of time. If multiple people concurrently reserve the same room, all but one of the reservations has to be adjusted.</li>
<li><strong>Bibliographic database.</strong> Consider an application like Google scholar in which users insert entries for a particular paper. Each paper is assigned a unique id. If two users concurrently add the same paper with different ids or add different papers with the same id, there is a conflict.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conflict-detection-and-resolution">Conflict Detection and Resolution</h2>
<p>Bayou replicates collections across a number of servers. Whenever a server receives a write, it annotates it with a globally unique id and eventually propagates it to other servers via periodic gossip. Servers order these writings according to their ids and execute them in order. Imagine if two servers concurrently receive writes which they then propagate to one another. These writes may conflict and need to be resolved. Bayou allows applications to provide application-specific definitions of <em>what</em> a conflict is and <em>how</em> to resolve it.</p>
<p>For example, consider again the meeting room scheduler from above. Bayou could automatically detect concurrent writes to the same page and mark them as conflicts, but if these two writes affect different meeting rooms, there really is no conflict. Instead, Bayou allows the application to specify that there is only a conflict if two writes book the same room at the same time. Moreover, applications can also specify how to resolve conflicts. For example, the meeting room scheduler may resolve conflicts by reassigning one of the meetings to the next available time. Concretely, <strong>dependency checks</strong> allow users to specify conflicts, and <strong>merge procedures</strong> resolve them.</p>
<h3 id="dependency-checks">Dependency Checks</h3>
<p>Every write is bundled with a dependency check. A dependency check is a pair of (1) a SQL query over the state of a server and (2) an expected results. When servers execute a write, they first check that executing the query produces the expected result. For example, a write to book a meeting room could include a query which returns the meetings which book the same room at an overlapping time and expect to see the empty set. A dependency check could also check that the versions of previously read data are the same upon a write, similar to an optimistic concurrency control scheme. If the dependency check fails, the merge procedure is executed.</p>
<h3 id="merge-procedures">Merge Procedures</h3>
<p>A merge procedure is a program written in a high-level interpreted language that is run atomically whenever a conflict is detected. The merge procedure modifies the write to one that will succeed. If it cannot be modified, it writes enough information so that a user can later manually fix things. For example, a write to book a meeting room could be bundled with a merge procedure that tries to book other times.</p>
<h2 id="replica-consistency">Replica Consistency</h2>
<p>Every server maintains a logical timestamp that is roughly kept in correspondence with its physical time. Servers tag writes with an id of the form (timestamp, server id). These ids form a total order, and servers order writes with respect to it. Servers immediately apply writes whenever they are received, and these writes are <strong>tentative</strong>. Slowly, writes are deemed <strong>committed</strong> and ordered before the tentative writes. It's possible that a new write appears and is inserted in the middle of the sequence of writes. This forces a server to <em>undo</em> the affects of later writes. The undo process is described later.</p>
<h2 id="write-stability-and-commitment">Write Stability and Commitment</h2>
<p>When a write is applied by a server for the last time, it is considered <strong>stable</strong> (equivalently, committed). Clients can query servers to see which writes have been committed. How to servers commit writes? One approach is to commit a write whenever its timestamp is less than the current timestamp of all servers. Unfortunately, if any of the servers is disconnected, this strategy can delay commit. In Bayou, a single server is designated as the primary and determines the order in which writes are committed. If this primary becomes disconnected, other servers may not see committed data for a while.</p>
<h2 id="storage-system-implementation-issues">Storage System Implementation Issues</h2>
<p>There are three main components to each server: a write log, a tuple store, and an undo log.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Write log.</strong> Every server maintains a sequence of all writes ordered by id, committed writes appearing before tentative writes. As an optimization, the servers can throw away a prefix of the committed writes because they will never again be executed. However, if a server throws away a write, it must be sure not to reintroduce the write via gossip. To do so, servers maintain an O-vector which for each server, records the largest timestamp of a discarded write from that server. If the server receives a write from a server with a timestamp lower than the entry in the O-vector, the write can be discarded.</li>
<li><strong>Tuple store.</strong> The tuple store is an in-memory relational database which supports a subset of SQL. The database must present a view of the committed database as well as the tentative database. To do so, every tuple is annotated with a committed and tentative bit. Queries propagate these bits to outputs.</li>
<li><strong>Undo log.</strong> The undo log is used to undo things; it is not described in any detail.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="commentary">Commentary</h2>
<ul>
<li>The primary approach to committing does not seem well motivated. If the master crashes, you're out of luck.</li>
<li>Bayou's approach re-executes writes frequently.</li>
</ul>
