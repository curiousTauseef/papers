<p>Adapting traditional data provenance to distributed systems would make distributed systems easier to <em>debug</em>, <em>profile</em>, <em>audit</em>, and so on. To do so, provenance has to be augmented in the following ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional data lineage allows us to get the lineage of any output tuple produced by a query run against a fixed database. In a distributed system, it is still useful to know the lineage of a tuple stored at a node, but it is also useful to the know the lineage of tuples that existed in the past.</li>
<li>Networks are free to drop, delay, and reorder messages arbitrarily.</li>
<li>In a distributed system, lineage can either be computed <strong>proactively</strong> (i.e. provenance information is computed at runtime while the system executes) or <strong>reactively</strong> (i.e. inputs to programs can be logged and provenance can be re-derived on the fly). A provenance system would have to allow users to choose between these two alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>This paper presents <strong>distributed time-aware provenance</strong> (DTaP)---a form of distributed lineage that can handle the scenarios above---and an implementation of DTaP named <strong>DistTape</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="system-model">System Model</h2>
<p>We assume programs are written in NDLog: a variant of datalog intended for writing distributed systems. An NDLog program is executed by expanding each NDLog rule into multiple delta rules which compute the tuples that should be inserted and deleted from a node's relations. We can also capture the execution of an NDLog program with an <strong>execution trace</strong>: a sequence of all the insertions, deletions, and derivations that occur in the system. The execution trace is like a flattened version of every tuple's proof tree.</p>
<h2 id="dtap-model">DTaP Model</h2>
<p>First, a few definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>An update is either $+\tau$ (the derivation of tuple $\tau$) or $-\tau$ (the <em>un</em>derivation of tuple $\tau$). $\Delta \tau$ is used to range over both $+\tau$ and $-\tau$.</li>
<li>An event $d@N_i = (e, r, t, c, e')$ signifies that the inference rule instantiation $\frac{e \quad c}{e'}[r]$ occurred at time $t$ on node $N_i$.</li>
<li>A trace $\trace$ is a sequence of events.</li>
<li>A subtrace $\trace' \subseteq \trace$ is a subsequence of a trace.</li>
<li>Given a trace $\trace$, event $d_i@N_i$ happens-before $d_j@N_j$ if the former precedes the latter in $\trace$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given a trace $\trace$, DTaP models provenance as a graph $G(\trace) = (V, E)$ where each vertex is in one of six forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>INSERT</code>$(t, n, \tau)$ signifies that tuple $\tau$ was inserted at node $n$ at time $t$.</li>
<li><code>DELETE</code>$(t, n, \tau)$ signifies that tuple $\tau$ was deleted at node $n$ at time $t$.</li>
<li><code>DERIVE</code>$(t, n, r, \tau)$ signifies that tuple $\tau$ was derived using rule $r$ at node $n$ at time $t$.</li>
<li><code>UNDERIVE</code>$(t, n, r, \tau)$ signifies that tuple $\tau$ was underived using rule $r$ at node $n$ at time $t$.</li>
<li><code>SEND</code>$(t, n, \Delta \tau, n')$ was sent from node $n$ to node $n'$ at time $t$.</li>
<li><code>RECEIVE</code>$(t, n', \Delta \tau, n)$ was received at node $n'$ (sent from node $n$) at time $t$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edges are added in a straightforward way. For example, when a base tuple is inserted, an <code>INSERT</code> vertex is created. Or, when a tuple is derived, a <code>DERIVE</code> vertex is created. Or, when a tuple is sent from one node to another, a <code>SENT</code> vertex is created. The graph represents a proof tree in much the same way it does in <em>TAP: Time-aware Provenance for Distributed Systems</em>.</p>
<p>Given a provenance graph $G(\trace)$, the provenance of event $\Delta \tau$, denoted $G(\Delta\tau, \trace)$, is the subgraph of $G(\trace)$ rooted at the <code>INSERT</code> or <code>DELETE</code> node corresponding to $\Delta\tau$. Let $\mathcal{A}(\Delta\tau, \trace)$ be the subsequence of $\trace$ obtained by a topological sort of $G(\Delta\tau, \trace)$. The paper defines what it means for $\mathcal{A}(\Delta\tau, \trace)$ to be <strong>valid</strong>, <strong>sound</strong>, <strong>complete</strong>, and <strong>minimal</strong> and argues that it is all four.</p>
<h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h2>
<p>The DTaP graph is stored in four relations: <code>prov</code>, <code>ruleExec</code>, <code>send</code>, and <code>recv</code> where</p>
<ul>
<li><code>prov(@N, VID, Time, RLoc, RID)</code> represents that tuple with VID <code>VID</code> was derived at node <code>N</code> at time <code>Time</code> using the rule with RID <code>RID</code> on node <code>RLoc</code>.</li>
<li><code>ruleExec(@RLoc, RID, Rule, ExecTime, Event, CList)</code> indicates that the rule with RID <code>RID</code> and label <code>Rule</code> executed at <code>RLoc</code> at time <code>ExecTime</code> with children <code>Event</code> and <code>CList</code>.</li>
<li><code>send(@Sender, VID, STime, RID)</code> signifies that rule with RID <code>RID</code> at node <code>Sender</code> sent the tuple with VID <code>VID</code> at time <code>STime</code>.</li>
<li><code>recv(@Receiver, VID, RTime, Sender, STime)</code> signifies that <code>Receiver</code> received tuple with VID <code>VID</code> at <code>RTime</code> from <code>Sender</code> which sent it at time <code>STime</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>NDLog programs are rewritten to maintain all four relations as they execute. See paper for details. As discussed earlier, provenance information can be computed proactively or reactively. When computed proactively, all provenance information is computed during execution. When computed reactively, only inputs are logged, and provenance is re-derived on the fly during query time. The reactive approach can also be combined with checkpointing.</p>
<h2 id="querying">Querying</h2>
<p>Given a query <code>provQuery(@N, VID, Time)</code>, DistTape generates a set of NDLog rules which recursively walk the relations and build the provenance tree. The rules are also parametrized by UDFs which users can modify to tune the behavior of the queries.</p>
<h2 id="cost-based-optimization">Cost-Based Optimization</h2>
<p>Many things affect whether proactive or reactive provenance is superior. For example, if provenance queries are rare, then the storage overhead of reactive provenance likely outweighs the increased query time. In order to intelligently choose between proactive and reactive provenance, DistTape includes a cost-based decision procedure. The decision procedure is parametrized on many parameters including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average number of predicates in rule bodies.</li>
<li>The size of a log entry.</li>
<li>The message frequency.</li>
<li>The query frequency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these parameters, DistTape has a formula for the storage overhead and query latency for the proactive and reactive models which can be used to decide between the two. The current prototype only supports choosing ahead of time, but a more sophisticated implementation could dynamically switch between the two at runtime.</p>
