<p>Bigtable is a non-relational database developed at Google that is distributed across 1000s of machines storing petabytes of data. Bigtable is built using a lot of other Google technology (e.g. GFS, Chubby, Borg, SSTable) and can achieve both high throughput and low latency.</p>
<h2 id="data-model-and-api">Data Model and API</h2>
<p>In short, Bigtable is a &quot;sparse, distributed, persistent multi-dimensional sorted map&quot; of type: <code>(key: string * column: string * timestamp: int64) -&gt; value: string</code>. For example, a web Bigtable could be keyed by URL with columns like language or content. Each entry in this Bigtable could have multiple timestamped versions.</p>
<p>Operations on a single Bigtable row are transactional, though Bigtable does not support multi-row transactions. The keys are also sorted lexicographically and a range of keys, known as a <strong>tablet</strong>, is the unit of replication and locality. This lets users colocate two keys by making the keys lexicographically close to one another.</p>
<p>Columns in Bigtable are grouped into (a modest number of static) <strong>column families</strong> where each column family is a unit of access control. Bigtables can be scanned by row and by column.</p>
<p>Timestamps are 64 bit integers and can either be assigned by Bigtable in an increasing way or assigned by the user program. Values can be garbage collected by keeping at most <code>n</code> objects at a time or by keeping all objects that are <code>n</code> seconds old.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>BigTable consists of a single <strong>master</strong>, a bunch of <strong>tablet servers</strong>, and a bunch of <strong>clients</strong>. The master is responsible for system administration. It assigns tablets to tablet servers, oversees the addition and removal of tablet servers, performs garbage collection, orchestrates load balancing, and manages schema changes. Tablet servers host 10-1000 tables and are responsible for servicing reads and writes. They also split tablets that have grown too large.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tablet location.</strong> The mapping from tablets to tablet servers is managed by a hierarchical metadata tree. First, a Chubby file contains the location of a <strong>root tablet</strong>: the first tablet in the METADATA table. The root tablet contains the addresses of the other tablets in the METADATA table which in turn store the locations of user tablets. Clients walk this hierarchy in order to find tablet servers. Note that tablets can find the location of a tablet without talking to the master.</li>
<li><strong>Tablet assignment.</strong> Each tablet is assigned to a single tablet server, and tablet assignments are managed by the master.
<ul>
<li>When a tablet server wants to join Bigtable, it acquires an exclusive lock on a file in the <code>servers</code> directory in Chubby. So long as it has the lock, it can serve tablets. If it loses the lock, it tries to reacquire it, and if the file is deleted, the tablet server kills itself. The master heartbeats servers periodically. If the server doesn't respond or the server reports it lost the lock, the master tries to acquire the lock. If it does, it deletes the file and reassigns tablets.</li>
<li>When a master joins Bigtable, it acquires an exclusive lock on a master file. It then scans the <code>servers</code> directory, contacts the servers to see what tablets they own, and compares it to the METADATA table. It can then start assigning unassigned tablets. It also manages the creation, deletion, and merging of tablets. Tablet servers manage the splitting of tablets.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tablet serving.</strong> Tablet servers commit updates to a log and also buffer the most recent updates in a sorted <strong>memtable</strong>. The rest of the data is stored in a series of SSTables in GFS. Each SSTable is a persistent immutable ordered mapping from strings to strings. If a tablet server crashes, its state can be recovered from its log. When a tablet server services a read or write, it performs access checks and whatnot and then resolves the read using the memtable and SSTables.</li>
<li><strong>Compactions.</strong> Periodically, the memtable is written as an SSTable to GFS; this is called a <strong>minor compaction</strong>. Also periodically, the memtable and multiple SSTables are merged into a single SSTable; this is called a <strong>merging compaction</strong>. If all data is compacted into a single SSTable, it's called a <strong>major compaction</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="refinements">Refinements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locality groups.</strong> Bigtable column families can be grouped together into a <strong>locality group</strong> for individual storage. Locality groups can also be designated in-memory.</li>
<li><strong>Compression.</strong> Users can specify that data should be compressed. Bigtable uses a two-pass compression scheme that favors compression speed or space, but in practice, the compression is pretty good.</li>
<li><strong>Caching.</strong> Tablet servers have a <strong>scan cache</strong> for temporal locality and a <strong>block cache</strong> for spatial locality.</li>
<li><strong>Bloom filters.</strong> When a tablet server services a read, it may have to read through every SSTable which can be expensive. To avoid this, tablet servers can use Bloom filters to probabilistically determine that an SSTable doesn't have a certain key.</li>
<li><strong>Commit log.</strong> Having a commit log per tablet leads to lots of random writes and smaller batches, so tablet servers merge updates for multiple tablets into a single commit log. This can complicate tablet recovery when multiple servers read a commit log applying a small fraction of the updates. To avoid this, the commit log can be sorted before being scanned.</li>
<li><strong>Immutability.</strong> The immutability of SSTables allows for concurrent reads without synchronization.</li>
