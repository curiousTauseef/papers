<h1 id="edelweiss-automatic-storage-reclamation-for-distributed-programming">Edelweiss: Automatic storage reclamation for distributed programming</h1>
<p>Shared mutable state is hard to reason about in distributed systems. As a result, many systems avoid shared mutable state in favor of having nodes accumulate immutable messages (or events) in a log and share the logs with other nodes. This paradigm is known as <em>Event Log Exchange</em> (ELE). While the ELE paradigm is often easier to reason about, the fact that event logs are perpetually growing makes it challenging to reclaim memory. Many existing storage systems write their own custom memory reclamation protocols. Edelweiss is a subset of Bloom. Edelweiss programs are written in the ELE style but can be automatically converted to a Bloom program which efficiently reclaims memory.</p>
<h2 id="bloom-and-edelweiss.">Bloom and Edelweiss.</h2>
<p>Recall that a Bloom program runs on a set of <em>nodes</em>. Each node manages a set of local <em>collections</em> and uses <em>rules</em> to update those collections. Processing proceeds in <em>timesteps</em>. At the beginning of each timestep, nodes receive messages over the network and add them to their local collections. During the timestep, the rules are run to a fixed point. This in turn might generate messages which are sent to other nodes.</p>
<p>The collections can be persisted <em>tables</em>, views known as <em>scratches</em>, or <em>channels</em> which are pseudo-tables used to send messages to other nodes. Collections are updated with merge (<code>&lt;=</code>), deferred merge (<code>&lt;+</code>), deferred delete (<code>&lt;-</code>), and async merge (<code>&lt;~</code>) operators.</p>
<p>A <em>persistent</em> table is one that only ever grows over time. All tables are persistent unless they appear on the left hand side of a <code>&lt;-</code> operation. Scratches are persistent if they are derived from other persistent tables monotonically.</p>
<p>Edelweiss is a subset of Bloom with the following restrictions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Deletion rules (<code>&lt;-</code>) are prohibited.</li>
<li>Channel messages are stored persistently.</li>
<li>Channels are derived from persistent collections.</li>
</ol>
<p>These restrictions imply that all tables are persistent, though not all scratches necessarily are. Moreover, once a message is sent, it is never intended to be retracted. And, once a node receives a message, it persists it.</p>
<p>Edelweiss performs the following program rewrites which reduces the memory overhead of the program without changing its behavior.</p>
<h2 id="avoidance-of-redundant-messages-arm.">Avoidance of Redundant Messages (ARM).</h2>
<p>Assume an Edelweiss program forwards the contents of a relation into a channel:</p>
<pre><code>chn &lt;~ X</code></pre>
<p>Because of restriction 2, all messages are persisted, so duplicate messages can be suppressed. To do so, a new <code>chn_ack</code> and <code>chn_approx</code> channel is created. Whenever a node receives a message over the channel, it sends an acknowledgement on <code>chn_ack</code>. Whenever a node receives an acknowledgement, it persists it in <code>chn_approx</code>. The rule above is then rewritten to the following:</p>
<pre><code>chn &lt;~ X.notin(chn_approx)</code></pre>
<h2 id="positive-difference-reclamation-dr.">Positive Difference Reclamation (DR+).</h2>
<p>Consider a rule of the form</p>
<pre><code>chn &lt;~ X.notin(Y)</code></pre>
<p>where both <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are persistent. Once a tuple <code>t</code> appears in <code>Y</code>, it will never again appear in <code>X.notin(Y)</code>. Thus, <code>t</code> can be removed from <code>X</code>. However, removing <code>t</code> from <code>X</code> might affect some other rule like:</p>
<pre><code>s &lt;= X</code></pre>
<p>where <code>s</code> is a scratch. If we can determine that removing <code>t</code> from <code>X</code> will not affect any other rules, then we can remove tuples like <code>t</code> from it using a rule like the following:</p>
<pre><code>X &lt;- X intersect Y</code></pre>
<h2 id="range-compression.">Range Compression.</h2>
<p>Say we have a persistent table <code>Y</code> that contains ids. <code>chn_ack</code> is one such table. These tables can grow without bound. We can compactly represent <code>Y</code> as a set of ranges. For example, the relation <code>Y = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10}</code> can be represented as <code>{[0, 3], [5,7], [9, 10]}</code>. Assuming that <code>Y</code> doesn't have too many holes, this representation will be compact.</p>
<h2 id="punctuations.">Punctuations.</h2>
<p>Consider a rule of the following form:</p>
<pre><code>chn &lt;~ (X join Y) - Z</code></pre>
<p>for a persistent <code>Z</code>. As we learned with DR+, if a tuple <code>t</code> appears in <code>Z</code>, then it can be reclaimed from <code>X join Y</code>, but when can we remove a tuple from <code>Y</code>? Well, to remove a tuple <code>t</code> from <code>Y</code>, we must know that</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>every tuple formed by joining <code>t</code> is in <code>Z</code> and</li>
<li>there will never be a new tuple <code>u</code> in <code>X</code> that joins with <code>t</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Checking 1 is easy, we just take the join of <code>t</code> with <code>X</code>. To ensure 2, we have to guarantee ourselves that a tuple matching <code>t</code> will never show up in <code>X</code>. We can accomplish this with punctuations. One way to punctuate <code>X</code> is to mark it as sealed which says that its size is fixed. Alternatively, we can have punctuations like <code>X</code> will never receive any message from epoch 42.</p>
<h2 id="negative-difference-reclamation-dr-.">Negative Difference Reclamation (DR-).</h2>
<p>Consider rules of the form</p>
<pre><code>chn &lt;~ X - Y</code></pre>
<p>We saw that we can use DR+ to remove a tuple <code>t</code> from <code>X</code> once it appears in <code>Y</code>. After we remove <code>t</code> from <code>X</code>, can we remove it from <code>Y</code>? No. <code>t</code> may be sent multiple times and reappear in <code>X</code>. To reclaim tuples from <code>Y</code>, we have to do something a bit more clever to ensure that once a tuple is removed from <code>X</code>, it will never appear again.</p>
<p>We create a relation <code>X_keys</code> which contains the keys of any element that has appeared in <code>X</code>. When a tuple <code>t</code> arrives, it is not inserted back into <code>X</code> if its key appears in <code>X_keys</code>. By doing this, we can reclaim tuples from <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> simultaneously resting assured that the tuple will never again appear in <code>X</code>.</p>
<h2 id="applications.">Applications.</h2>
<p>Using these optimizations, we can apply them to simple unicast protocols, broadcast protocols, key-value stores, causally consistent key-value stores, and single-node registers.</p>
