<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Hadoop began as a MapReduce clone designed for large scale web crawling. As big data became trendy and data became... big, Hadoop became the de facto standard data processing system, and large Hadoop clusters were installed in many companies as &quot;the&quot; cluster. As application requirements evolved, users started abusing the large Hadoop in unintended ways. For example, users would submit map-only jobs which were thinly guised web servers. Apache Hadoop YARN is a cluster manager that aims to disentangle cluster management from programming paradigm and has the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalability</li>
<li>Multi-tenancy</li>
<li>Serviceability</li>
<li>Locality awareness</li>
<li>High cluster utilization</li>
<li>Reliability/availability</li>
<li>Secure and auditable operation</li>
<li>Support for programming model diversity</li>
<li>Flexible resource model</li>
<li>Backward compatibility</li>
</ul>
<p>YARN is orchestrated by a per-cluster <em>Resource Manager</em> (RM) that tracks resource usage and node liveness, enforces allocation invariants, and arbitrates contention among tenants. <em>Application Masters</em> (AM) are responsible for negotiating resources with the RM and manage the execution of single job. AMs send ResourceRequests to the RM telling it resource requirements, locality preferences, etc. In return, the RM hands out <em>containers</em> (e.g. &lt;2GB RAM, 1 CPU&gt;) to AMs. The RM also communicates with Node Managers (NM) running on each node which are responsible for measuring node resources and managing (i.e. starting and killing) tasks. When a user want to submit a job, it sends it to the RM which hands a capability to an AM to present to an NM. The RM is a single point of failure. If it fails, it restores its state from disk and kills all running AMs. The AMs are trusted to be faul-tolerant and resubmit any prematurely terminated jobs.</p>
<p>YARN is deployed at Yahoo where it manages roughly 500,000 daily jobs. YARN supports frameworks like Hadoop, Tez, Spark, Dryad, Giraph, and Storm.</p>
