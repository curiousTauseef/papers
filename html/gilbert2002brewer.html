<p>Informally, The CAP theorem states that partition-tolerant distributed systems cannot be simultaneously consistent and available. Informally,</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>consistent</em> system is one which provides ACID-like guarantees;</li>
<li>an <em>available</em> system is one where every request is met with a successful response;</li>
<li>a <em>partition-tolerant</em> system is one which behaves correctly despite the possibility of partitions (duh!).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Formal Model.</strong> Formally, we'll consider a distributed system that implements a single readable and writeable <em>data object</em>. We say the data object is atomic, or consistent, if it is linearizable. We say the data object is available if &quot;every request received by a non-failing node in the system [results] in a response.&quot; During a network partition, messages sent across the partition can be arbitrarily lost. Worse, any message can be lost by modelling it as an instantaneous network partition between the sender and receiver. Thus, a partition-tolerant system must be able to handle arbitrary message loss.</p>
<p><strong>Asynchronous Networks Impossibility Result.</strong> In an asynchronous network, messages can be reordered and delayed arbitrarily. Moreover, nodes do not have any form of clock. They must &quot;make decisions based only on the messages received.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Theorem 1</em> It is impossible in the asynchronous network model to implement a read/write data object that guarantees availability and atomic consistency in all fair executions (including those in which messages are lost).</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Assume for contradiction there is a distributed system under the asynchronous network model with at least two nodes that is available and consistent in all fair executions. Partition the network into two non-empty subsets <code>G1</code> and <code>G2</code>, and assume that all messages are dropped between the two partitions. Also assume the system has initial value <code>v0</code>. Consider an execution which first sends a write request with value <code>v1 != v0</code> to <code>G1</code>. By availability, the write must be accepted. After it does, we issue a read request to <code>G2</code>. Again by availability, we must receive a response. Since <code>G2</code> has received no messages from <code>G1</code>, it must return <code>v0</code> which is inconsistent.</p>
<p>In our proof, we assumed that messages between the two partitions were dropped. In the asynchronous model, this assumption is actually too strong. Intuitively, <code>G2</code> cannot differentiate between dropped and delayed messages, so it suffices to delay messages between <code>G1</code> and <code>G2</code> rather than just dropping them.</p>
<p><em>Corollary 1.1</em> It is impossible in the asynchronous network model to implement a read/write data object that guarantees availability in all fair executions and atomic consistency in fair executions in which no messages are lost.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Take the counterexample execution from above. After the read returns, deliver all outstanding messages from <code>G1</code> to <code>G2</code>. In this execution, all messages are delivered, but the system is still inconsistent.</p>
<p><strong>Solutions in the Asynchronous Model.</strong> The CAP theorem tells us that partition-tolerant distributed registers cannot be simultaneously consistent and available, but we can settle for less.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>CP</em>. Trivially, a system which drops all requests is CP. However, we can often provide much better availability than this. For example, imagine if all nodes in the system forwarded requests to a single master node. This system is consistent, and as long as the master is alive, it is also available.</li>
<li><em>CA</em>. If you assume partitions will never happen, then you can have a consistent and available system.</li>
<li><em>AP</em>. Trivially, a system which always returns the initial value is available and partition-tolerant. Alternatively, you can settle for one of many weak consistency models.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Partially Synchronous Networks Impossibility Result.</strong> In the partially synchronous network model, nodes are equipped with timers that progress at the same rate. This allows them to trigger events to occur after a certain amount of time. For example, they can send a message and wait for a response with a timeout. Moreover, we assume that every message is delivered in at most <code>t_msg</code> or is otherwise lost.</p>
<p><em>Theorem 2.</em> It is impossible in the partially synchronous network model to implement a read/write data object that guarantees availability and atomic consistency in all executions (even those in which messages are lost).</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> The proof is the same as the proof for Theorem 1 with some slight differences I don't quite understand.</p>
<p><strong>Solutions in Partially Synchronous Networks.</strong> The partially synchronous analogue of Corollary 1.1 does not hold. That is, assuming all messages are delivered, a system can achieve both consistency and availability. For example, the CP system described above satisfies this property.</p>
<p><strong>Weaker Consistency.</strong> We can easily implement weaker consistency models in the partially synchronous network model. Here, we define <em>t-Connected Consistency</em>. We say an execution of a read-write object is t-Connected Consistent if</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If no messages are lost, t-Consistent Consistency is equivalent to linearizability.</li>
<li>If messages are lost, then there exists a partial order P such that
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Writes are totally ordered in P, and reads are ordered with respect to writes.</li>
<li>The value returned by every read is the value of the preceding write or the initial value if no such write exists.</li>
<li>The ordering of events at each node is respected by P.</li>
<li>If there is an interval of time longer than t in which no messages are lost, a completes before the interval, and b starts after the interval, then b does not precede a in P.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Intuitively, t-Connected Consistency is very similar to linearizability except that requests can be reordered when messages are being dropped. We can implement a read-write data object that is t-Connected Consistent for some t defined below. We designate a single node as the master node.</p>
<ul>
<li>When a read arrives at a node, it forwards it to the master. If the master responds, the value is cached and returned to the client. If the master does not respond, then the value with the highest sequence number cached at the node is returned to the client.</li>
<li>When a write arrives at a node, it sends it to the master. The node acknowledges the client after a response from the master or after a timeout. The node periodically sends unacknowledged values to the master.</li>
<li>When a write arrives at the master, it assigns the write an increasing sequence number. Periodically, it broadcasts the latest value and sequence number.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let P be the partial order where writes are ordered according to their sequence number and reads follow the write that produced its value. Letting t be enough time for a write to commit and a broadcast to happen, this system is t-Connected Consistent.</p>
