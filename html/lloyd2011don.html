<p><strong>Overview.</strong> Many modern applications require high <strong>a</strong>vailability, low <strong>l</strong>atency, <strong>p</strong>artition tolerance, and <strong>s</strong>calability. The CAP theorem tells us that these kind of applications, dubbed <em>ALPS</em> applications, cannot be implemented with strong consistency. However, weaker consistency models can be implemented with high availability. This paper introduces <em>causal consistency with convergent conflict handling</em> (causal+ consistency), one of the strongest consistency models that can be supported with high availability, and a causal+ consistent key-value store COPS. It also extends COPS with multi-key get transactions in a system dubbed COPS-GT.</p>
<p><strong>Causal+ Consistency.</strong> We model our system as set of independently executing threads of execution that issue <code>get(key)</code> and <code>put(key, val)</code> operations against one replica of a key-value store. We say operation <code>a</code> happens before operation <code>b</code>, denoted <code>a -&gt; b</code> if</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>a</code> happens before <code>b</code> in a single thread of execution,</li>
<li><code>a = get(key)</code> returns the value written by <code>b = put(key, val)</code>, or</li>
<li>there exists a <code>c</code> such that <code>a -&gt; c</code> and <code>c -&gt; b</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A system is causally consistent if reads respect the causal ordering of events. That is, it must appear the operation that writes a value occurs after all operations that causally proceed it. For example, imagine Alice adds a photo to Facebook and then adds a reference to the photo to an album. If Bob sees the photo reference in the album, then the photo being referenced must exist. Causal+ consistent is weaker than linearizability and sequential consistency but is stronger than causal, PRAM, per-key sequential, and eventual consistency.</p>
<p>Causal consistency governs the behavior of causally related operations; it doesn't help much to resolve causally unrelated operations. For example, when two unrelated writes to the same object happen, a causally consistent system is allowed to indefinitely return either value. Convergent conflict handling requires that all replicas resolve the conflict in the same way using an associative and commutative merge operator. COPS allows the user to specify application specific merge operators but otherwise defaults to use a last-writer-wins rule.</p>
<p>In COPS, values are versioned with the guarantee that if <code>x_i -&gt; x_j</code> then <code>i &lt; j</code>. That is, values are versioned with Lamport timestamps. Moreover, once COPS returns a value, it guarantees to return the same version of a causally later one, so version numbers are monotonically non-decreasing.</p>
<p><strong>Design.</strong> A COPS system is divided between multiple data centers connected by a wide-area network. Each data center represents one logical replica of the entire key-value store. Within the data center, the key space is sharded between servers and linearizability is provided by using chained replication. Updates within a data center are asynchronously sent to other data centers in a causal+ consistent fashion.</p>
<p>COPS clients issue get and put operations to COPS. Furthermore, each operation is associated with a context and each context can have at most one outstanding operation at a time. The operations associated with a context for a logical thread of execution. The context maintains a table of (key, version, dependency) pairs. When a client issues a write, it includes a list of the versions the write depends on (i.e. the list of versions that causally precede this write). COPS servers block until the dependencies are themselves committed to the database to ensure causal consistency.</p>
<p>Get operations in COPS are rather straightforward, but they are often inexpressive. For example, imagine Alice unfriends Bob and then uploads a private photo that she doesn't want Bob to see. Bob's client could read Alice's old friend list, see that Bob is still her friend, and then read Alice's new private photo. COPS-GT extends COPS with get transactions which allow multiple keys to be read simultaneously in a causally consistent way. A get transaction for keys <code>k1, ..., kn</code> proceeds in two steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>First, the latest versions and dependencies of every key is read from COPS. For example, COPS may return <code>z_3 = 4</code> which depends on <code>x_2</code> and <code>y_2</code>.</li>
<li>Next, for every dependency <code>x_i</code> where <code>x</code> is a key in the transaction, if the value of <code>x</code> read is not at least as large as <code>i</code>, then another read is issued to read a value at least as large as <code>i</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Garbage Collection.</strong> There are miscellaneous pieces of metadata in COPS that can be garbage collected. For example, COPS-GT maintains many versions of each key-value pair so that a get transaction can issue a read request at older values. If we're not careful, the size of this metadata could grow without bound. COPS bounds the duration of get transactions to some arbitrary time <code>T</code>, restarting any transactions that last longer than <code>T</code>. Then, once a new version of a value is written, the old ones can be garbage collected after roughly <code>T</code> amount of time.</p>
<p><strong>Fault Tolerance.</strong> Fault tolerance is provided using chain-replication. If a data center goes down, data could be lost, but woe is the way of a highly available system.</p>
