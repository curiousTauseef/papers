<p>Parallel and distributed programming is hard. Dryad is a programming framework, inspired by parallel databases and MapReduce, which makes distributed data-parallel program easy by abstracting resource allocation, scheduling, failure handling, straggler mitigation, etc. In Dryad, computation is expressed as a directed acyclic graph. The vertexes run user code. The edges, also known as channels, send data in some form (e.g TCP, files). Users write vertexes and build graphs using a simple graph description language.</p>
<p><strong>System Overview.</strong> Logically, Dryad computations are expressed as directed acyclic graphs of vertexes (code) and edges (transport). Vertexes can send arbitrary data across edges; they are responsible for handling data appropriately. Physically, Dryad execution is orchestrated by a single <em>Job Manager</em> (JM) which can run on a user's machine or in a cluster. The JM contacts a <em>Name Service</em> (NS) to get the addresses and locations of a cluster of workers. Each worker runs a daemon which coordinates with the JM. The JM, NS, and workers can also be run on a programmer's machine for debugging. The whole system uses a distributed file system like GFS.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the following SQL query over a database of celestial objects. The query computes the set of planets with a similarly colored neighbor. A RDBMS can execute this query as a pair of index-only joins: one index on photoObjAll and one on neighbors.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT p.objID
FROM photoObjAll p
JOIN neighbors n
ON p.objID = n.objID
    AND n.objID &lt; n.neighborObjID
    AND p.mode = 1
JOIN photoObjAll l
ON l.objID = n.neighborObjID
    AND l.mode = 1
    AND abs((p.u - p.g) - (l.u - l.g)) &lt; 0.05
    AND abs((p.g - p.r) - (l.g - l.r)) &lt; 0.05
    AND abs((p.r - p.i) - (l.r - l.i)) &lt; 0.05
    AND abs((p.i - p.z) - (l.i - l.z)) &lt; 0.05</code></pre>
<p>In Dryad, we can represent it as a graph where:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Partition the index into pairs <code>U1, N1, ..., Un, Nn</code>.</li>
<li>One node reads each partition and computes a local join.</li>
<li>The data is shuffled and partitioned based on neighborObjID.</li>
<li>The data is sorted on neighborObjID.</li>
<li>The data is joined with photoObjAll to get the color of the neighbors and filtered.</li>
<li>The data is sent to a single node for distinct.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Describing a Dryad Graph.</strong> Dryad uses a C++ DSL to merge subgraphs into bigger graphs. A graph is a four-tuple <code>G = (V_G, E_G, I_G, E_G)</code> where</p>
<ul>
<li><code>V_G</code> is a vector of vertexes,</li>
<li><code>E_G</code> is a set of edges over <code>V_G</code>,</li>
<li><code>I_G</code> is a subset of <code>V_G</code>: the input vertexes, and</li>
<li><code>O_G</code> is a subset of <code>V_G</code>: the output vertexes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edges are ordered and multiple edges can exist between a pair of vertexes. Here are the operation we can use to build or compose graphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vertex programs are written as a subclass of a C++ <code>Vertex</code> class. Given a vertex, we can construct the graph <code>([v], {}, {v}, {v})</code>.</li>
<li>Given a graph <code>G</code>, we can duplicate the graph <code>n</code> times, denoted <code>G^n</code>.</li>
<li><code>A &gt;= B</code> hooks up the outputs of <code>A</code> in a round-robin fashion to the inputs of <code>B</code>.</li>
<li><code>A &gt;&gt; B</code> hooks up the every output of <code>A</code> to every input of <code>B</code>.</li>
<li><code>A || B</code> merges <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> by taking the union of the vertex, edge, input, and output sets.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the edges between vertexes are represented as temporary files. The upstream node writes to a local file, and the downstream node reads form it. In addition to this file-based edge, multiple vertexes can also be run in the same process and communicate via an in-memory pipe. Alternatively, nodes can communicate via TCP.</p>
<p><strong>Writing a Vertex Program.</strong> Vertexes are represented as arbitrary C++ classes that subclass from a <code>Vertex</code> interface. The interface exposes a <code>Main</code> method which takes in a number of readers and writers. Vertexes can also report their status to the JM. Writing custom vertexes can sometimes be difficult. Dryad also includes a standard set of default vertexes like map, filter, join. Legacy binaries can also be run as vertexes.</p>
<p><strong>Job Execution.</strong> There is a single JM which is a point-of-failure. Of course, the JM could use snapshotting or replication. Multiple copies of the same vertex may be run due to failures and re-execution, so it assumed that vertexes are deterministic. Vertexes can also provide a preference list describing which machine they want to run on. This allows a graph to place computation near its input or to group similar nodes. There are also nice monitoring tools to view the progress of a Dryad execution.</p>
<p>Each vertex in a graph is put into a stage. Each stage has a stage manager which manages the execution of the stage. The stage managers do things like re-execute tasks to avoid stragglers.</p>
<p>The Dryad graph can also be changed at runtime to support optimization like tree aggregation or partial aggregation.</p>
<p><strong>Building on Dryad.</strong> Dryad provides a rather low-level C++ interface. Other teams have developed higher-level interfaces to Dryad including a Nebual scripting language, integration with a RDBMS, and hope for integration with SQL or LINQ.</p>
