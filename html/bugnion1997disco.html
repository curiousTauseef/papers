<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Operating systems are complex, million line code bases. Multiprocessors were becoming popular, but it was too difficult to modify existing commercial operating systems to take full advantage of the new hardware. Disco is a <em>virtual machine monitor</em>, or <em>hypervisor</em>, that uses virtualization to run commercial virtual machines on cache-coherent NUMA multiprocessors. Guest operating systems running on Disco are only slightly modified, yet are still able to take advantage of the multiprocessor. Moreover, Disco offers all the traditional benefits of a hypervisor (e.g. fault isolation).</p>
<p>Disco provides the following interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Processors.</em> Disco provides full virtualization of the CPU allowing for restricted direct execution. Some privileged registers are mapped to memory to allow guest operating systems to read them.</li>
<li><em>Physical memory.</em> Disco virtualizes the guest operating system's physical address spaces, mapping them to hardware addresses. It also supports page migration and replication to alleviate the non-uniformity of a NUMA machine.</li>
<li><em>I/O devices.</em> All I/O communication is simulated, and various virtual disks are used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disco is implemented as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Virtual CPUs.</em> Disco maintains the equivalent of a process table entry for each guest operating system. Dicso runs in kernel mode, guest operating systems run in supervisor mode, and applications run in user mode.</li>
<li><em>Virtual physical memory.</em> To avoid the overhead of physical to hardware address translation, Disco maintains a large software physical to hardware TLB.</li>
<li><em>NUMA.</em> Disco migrates pages to the CPUs that access them frequently, and replicates read-only pages to the CPUs that read them frequently. This dynamic page migration and replications helps mask the non-uniformity of a NUMA machine.</li>
<li><em>Copy-on-write disks.</em> Disco can map physical addresses in different guest operating systems to a read-only page in hardware memory. This lowers the memory footprint of running multiple guest operating systems. The shared pages are copy-on-write.</li>
<li><em>Virtual network interfaces.</em> Disco runs a virtual subnet over which guests can communicate using standard communication protocols like NFS and TCP. Disco uses a similar copy-on-write trick as above to avoid copying data between guests.</li>
</ul>
