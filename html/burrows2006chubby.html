<p>Chubby is Google's distributed lock service, implemented using consensus, that allows clients to synchronize and agree on values. Chubby is like a file system in which clients read and write entire files, but it also supports advisory locks, event notification and more. Chubby's main goals are reliability, availability, and easy-to-understand semantics. It's secondary goals are throughput and storage capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale.</strong> Chubby is a centralized lock service that internally uses Paxos. There are a number of advantages to implementing a lock service rather than providing a Paxos library that clients can use directly:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Programs are often not written like state machines which makes it difficult to integrate something like Paxos. It is significantly easier to use change code to use a lock service.</li>
<li>Often, when Chubby is used for leader election, the elected leader has to advertise its address. Thus, it makes sense to add data serving functionality into the lock service.</li>
<li>Locks are more familiar to programmers than state machines.</li>
<li>To be fault tolerant and available, consensus algorithms require a minimum number of servers. By using a lock service, the need for multiple servers is centralized. Clients don't have to run their own clusters.</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, there are a number of other features that are useful to have in Chubby including event notification, consistent file caching, and security</p>
<p>Also note that Chubby is designed for coarse, as opposed to fine, grained locking. That is to say, clients hold locks for minutes to hours instead of seconds or less. This reduces the load on Chubby and makes clients less susceptible to Chubby crashes. Finer grained locking can also be implemented on top of Chubby.</p>
<p><strong>System Structure.</strong> Chubby consists of a client library linked into applications and a small cluster (typically 5) of servers called <em>replicas</em>. Replicas use consensus to elect a master for the duration of a master lease which can be renewed by the master. The master handles reads and writes which are copied to the replicas using consensus. DNS is used to find replicas, and replicas forward clients to the current master. If a replica is down for too long (e.g. multiple hours), then it is replaced, the DNS entries are updated to point at the new server, the new server receives data from backups and other replicas, and finally the master introduces it into the cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Files, directories, and handles.</strong> Files in Chubby are identified by a path <code>ls/cell/dir1/dir2/.../dirn/filename</code> where <code>ls</code> (lock service) identifies a Chubby file, <code>cell</code> is the name of a cell, and the rest of the path is a usual path. This naming structure integrates well into Google's existing file libraries and tools. Chubby makes a couple of simplifying assumptions about files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files cannot be moved between directories.</li>
<li>Directories do not maintain last modified times.</li>
<li>Permissions are per-file and do not depend on parents.</li>
<li>There are no soft or hard links; everything in the file tree is a <em>node</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Files can act as advisory locks, and file ACLs are themselves stored as files. Moreover, files can be <em>permanent</em> or <em>ephemeral</em>. An ephemeral file is deleted when no clients have it open; an ephemeral directory is deleted when it is empty.</p>
<p>Each node maintains four numbers which increase over time:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>An instance number which is incremented every time a file with a given name is created.</li>
<li>A content generation number which is incremented every time a file changes.</li>
<li>A lock generation number, which is incremented whenever a lock is acquired.</li>
<li>An ACL generation number which is incremented whenever ACLs are written.</li>
</ol>
<p>Files also include 64 bit checksums.</p>
<p><strong>Locks and sequencers.</strong> Using distributed locks can be tricky, especially when messages are delayed and locks are rapidly released and acquired. Each file in Chubby can act as an advisory reader-writer lock. Lock owners may request a sequencer which is an opaque byte-string with a name, mode, lock generation number etc. A client passes the sequencer to a server, like a file server, which can check the validity of the sequencer with Chubby. There is also a hackier way to prevent anomalies in which locks cannot be re-acquired since the last release until a <em>lock-delay</em> has passed.</p>
<p><strong>Events.</strong> Chubby clients can subscribe to events including:</p>
<ul>
<li>file changes,</li>
<li>children nodes are added, deleted, or changed,</li>
<li>master fail-over, and</li>
<li>a lock is acquired.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>API.</strong> The Chubby API includes <code>Open</code>, <code>Close</code>, <code>Poison</code>, <code>GetContentsAndStat</code>, <code>GetStat</code>, <code>ReadDir</code>, <code>SetContents</code> (with compare-and-swap semantics if need be), <code>Delete</code>, <code>Acquire</code>, <code>TryAcquire</code>, <code>Release</code>, <code>GetSequencer</code>, <code>SetSequencer</code>, and <code>CheckSequencer</code> calls.</p>
<p><strong>Caching.</strong> To reduce read load on Chubby, clients maintain a consistent write-through cache. The master tracks what each client has cached and issues leases and invalidations. Chubby uses a simple algorithm to keep caches consistent: when a client issues a write, the server sends invalidations to all clients who have the file cached. After all client caches have been invalidated, either by an acknowledgement or a lease expiration, the write is written.</p>
<p><strong>Sessions and keep-alives.</strong> Chubby sessions between clients and servers are maintained by periodic KeepAlive RPCs. Each session has a lease timeout before which the session is guaranteed not to expire, and leases are periodically renewed in three situations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>session creation,</li>
<li>master failover, and</li>
<li>KeepAlive delivery.</li>
</ol>
<p>Masters do not respond to KeepAlive RPCs immediately. Instead, they wait until just before the lease expires before responding. They also sent cache invalidations and event notifications as part of the RPC. Clients respond to KeepAlive RPCs immediately. Clients also conservatively estimate their lease timeouts with some assumptions on clock skew and packet delivery times. When a session expires, clients enter a 45 second grace period where they drop their cache. If they reconnect to a master, things continue as usual. Otherwise, they deliver an error to the user.</p>
<p><strong>Fail-over.</strong> If a master fails over, the client may reconnect to the new master during its grace period. The new master follows the following procedure:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Generates a new epoch number that is larger than all previous epoch numbers.</li>
<li>Responds to master location requests.</li>
<li>Builds its in-memory state from the database.</li>
<li>Responds to KeepAlive RPCs.</li>
<li>Delivers fail-over events to clients.</li>
<li>Waits for all existing sessions to expire or for fail-over messages to be acked.</li>
<li>Responds to all operations.</li>
<li>Recreates old handles when necessary.</li>
<li>Deletes ephemeral files after some delay.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>DB.</strong> Originally, Chubby used BerkeleyDB (BDB), but BDB's replication support was young. Moreover, Chubby didn't need all of the functionality. Ultimately, Chubby threw out BDB and implemented a persistence layer itself.</p>
<p><strong>Backup.</strong> Periodically, Chubby masters back up their state in another cell in GFS.</p>
<p><strong>Mirroring.</strong> Chubby's event notifications make it easy to mirror directories.</p>
