<p><strong>Summary.</strong> MillWheel is a stream processing system built at Google that models computation as a dynamic directed graph of <em>computations</em>. MillWheel allows user's to write arbitrary code as part of an operation yet still transparently enforces idempotency and exactly-once message delivery. MillWheel uses frequent checkpointing and upstream backup for recovery.</p>
<p>Data in MillWheel is represented by (key, value, timestamp) triples. Values and timestamps are both arbitrary. Keys are extracted from records by user provided key extraction functions. Computations operate on inputs and the computations for a single key are serialized; that is, no two computations on the same key will every happen at the same time. Moreover, each key is associated with some persistent state that a computation has access to when operating on the key.</p>
<p>MillWheel also supports <em>low watermarks</em>. If a computation has a low watermark of <code>t</code>, then it's guaranteed to have processed all records no later than <code>t</code>. Low watermarks use the logical timestamps in records as opposed to arrival time in systems like Spark Streaming. Low watermark guarantees are not actually guarantees; they are approximations. <em>Injectors</em> inject data into MillWheel and can still violate low watermarks semantics. When a watermark violating record enters the system, computations can choose to ignore it or try to correct it. Moreover, the MillWheel API allows users to register for code, known as <em>timers</em>, to execute at a certain wall clock or low watermark time.</p>
<p>MillWheel guarantees messages are logically sent exactly once. Messages may be sent multiple times within the system, but measures are taken to ensure that the system appears to have delivered them only once. Similar care must be taken to ensure that per-key persistent state is not updated erroneously. When a message is received at a computation, the following events happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data is deduplicated by checking first against a Bloom filter and then a disk.</li>
<li>User code is executed.</li>
<li>Pending changes to the persistent state are committed.</li>
<li>Senders are acknowledged.</li>
<li>Produced data is sent downstream.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine if a computation commits a change to persistent state but crashes before acking senders. If the computation is replayed, it may modify the persistent state twice. To avoid this, each record in the system is given a unique id. When state is modified in response to a record, the id of the record is atomically written with the state change. If a computation later re-processes the record and attempts to re-modify the state, the modification is ignored.</p>
<p>Before a record is sent downstream, it is checkpointed. These are called <em>strong productions</em>. Programs can opt out of strong productions and instead use <em>weak productions</em>: non-checkpointed productions. When using weak productions, MillWheel still performs occasional checkpoints to avoid a long chain of acknowledgements to be blocked by a straggling worker. Programs can also opt-out of exactly-once semantics.</p>
<p>To avoid zombie writers from corrupting state, each write is associated with a sequencer token that is invalidated when a new writer becomes active.</p>
<p>MillWheel is implemented using a replicated master that manages key-range assignments and a single central authority for computing low watermarks.</p>
<p><strong>Commentary.</strong> - Spark Streaming claims that using replication for recovery reduces the latency of the system. MillWheel frequently checkpoints data. This leads me to wonder if MillWheel experiences a latency hit, but the evaluation only considers single stage pipelines! - The evaluation does not evaluate the recovery time of the system, something that Spark Streaming would say is very slow. - The paper also says the Spark Streaming model is limiting and depends heavily on the RDD API. I wish there were a concrete example demonstrating Spark Streaming's inexpressiveness. - I'm having trouble understanding how the per-key API allows for things like joins.</p>
