<p><strong>Summary.</strong> In addition to serializability, ANSI SQL-92 defined a set of weaker isolation levels that applications could use to improve performance at the cost of consistency. The definitions were implementation-independent but ambiguous. Berenson et al. proposed a revision of the isolation level definitions that was unambiguous but specific to locking. Specifically, they define a set of <em>phenomena</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>P0: <code>w1(x) ... w2(x) ...</code> <em>&quot;dirty write&quot;</em></li>
<li>P1: <code>w1(x) ... r2(x) ...</code> <em>&quot;dirty read&quot;</em></li>
<li>P2: <code>r1(x) ... w2(x) ...</code> <em>&quot;unrepeatable read&quot;</em></li>
<li>P3: <code>r1(P) ... w2(y in P) ...</code> <em>&quot;phantom read&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>and define the isolation levels according to which phenomena they preclude. This preclusion can be implemented by varying how long certain types of locks are held:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>write locks</th>
<th>read locks</th>
<th>phantom locks</th>
<th>precluded</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>short</td>
<td>short</td>
<td>short</td>
<td>P0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>long</td>
<td>short</td>
<td>short</td>
<td>P0, P1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>long</td>
<td>long</td>
<td>short</td>
<td>P0, P1, P2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>long</td>
<td>long</td>
<td>long</td>
<td>P0, P1, P2, P3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This locking-specific <em>preventative</em> approach to defining isolation levels, while unambiguous, rules out many non-locking implementations of concurrency control. Notably, it does not allow for multiversioning and does not allow non-committed transactions to experience weaker consistency than committed transactions. Moreover, many isolation levels are naturally expressed as invariants between multiple objects, but these definitions are all over a single object.</p>
<p>This paper introduces implementation-independent unambiguous isolation level definitions. The definitions also include notions of predicates at all levels. It does so by first introducing the definition of a <em>history</em> as a partial order of read/write/commit/abort events and total order of commited object versions. It then introduces three dependencies: <em>read-dependencies</em>, <em>anti-dependencies</em>, and <em>write-dependencies</em> (also known as write-read, read-write, and write-write dependencies). Next, it describes how to construct dependency graph and defines isolation levels as constraints on these graphs.</p>
<p>For example, the G0 phenomenon says that a dependency graph contains a write-dependency cycle. PL-1 is the isolation level that precludes G0. Similarly, the G1 phenomenon says that either</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>a committed transaction reads an aborted value,</li>
<li>a committed transaction reads an intermediate value, or</li>
<li>there is a write-read/write-write cycle.</li>
</ol>
<p>The PL-2 isolation level precludes G1 (and therefore G0) and corresponds roughly to the READ-COMMITTED isolation level.</p>
